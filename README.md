# classroom-service

UNFINISHED

Service to help find classrooms around NYU. This will be available as a simple web API with a small frontend.

Depending on how much work there is to scrape or provide a JSON api for the room calendars.

Beginning with Courant Institute of Mathematics. The process follows:

1. Have a start and end date for the search.
2. Have a limitation (an upper bound) on the number of seats.
3. Provide a time during the day at which the event will take place.
4. Will return classroom IDs (if any) that are available.
5. Either halt the search or tweak the parameters.
